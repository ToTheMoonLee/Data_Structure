/**
 * Given a positive integer, output its complement number.
 * The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: 5
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits),
 * and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: 1
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits),
 * and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 * You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
 * This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
