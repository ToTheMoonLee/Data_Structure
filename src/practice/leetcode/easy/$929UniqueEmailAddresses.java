/**
 * Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign.
 *
 * For example, in alice@leetcode.com, alice is the local name, and leetcode.com is the domain name.
 *
 * Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain '.'s or '+'s.
 *
 * If you add periods ('.') between some characters in the local name part of an email address,
 * mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name.
 * For example, "alice.z@leetcode.com" and "alicez@leetcode.com" forward to the same email address.
 * (Note that this rule does not apply for domain names.)
 *
 * If you add a plus ('+') in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored.
 * This allows certain emails to be filtered, for example m.y+name@email.com will be forwarded to my@email.com.
 * (Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.)
 *
 * It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.
 *
 * Given a list of emails, we send one email to each address in the list.
 * How many different addresses actually receive mails?
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually receive mails
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 1 <= emails[i].length <= 100
 * 1 <= emails.length <= 100
 * Each emails[i] contains exactly one '@' character.
 * All local and domain names are non-empty.
 * Local names do not start with a '+' character.
