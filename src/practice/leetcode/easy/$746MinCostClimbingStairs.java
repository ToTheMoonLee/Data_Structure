 * On a staircase, the i-th step has some non-negative cost cost[i] assigned (0 indexed).
 *
 * Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.
 * You need to find minimum cost to reach the top of the floor,
 * and you can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: cost = [10, 15, 20]
 * Output: 15
 * Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[1], pay that cost and go to the top.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping cost[3].
 * Note:
 * cost will have a length in the range [2, 1000].
 * Every cost[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 999].
